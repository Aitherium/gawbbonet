> **The Aither World** is an operating system for agents — a Linux you can hand to one, the runtimes it works in, and the tools it works with. [awnix](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the Linux underneath it; **gawbbonet** is one of its 61 bricks — each installs on its own, runs offline, and needs no account.

> **Start here:** Run one campaign and ask it what happened three sessions ago.

<!-- aither-header:end -->

Run one GobboNet campaign where the harness, not the human, keeps the notes.

```bash
pip install gobbonet-agentic
```

```python
from gobbonet_agentic import Campaign, Harness

# Create a harness that keeps notes automatically
harness = Harness(notes_dir="/tmp/campaign_notes")

# Define and run a campaign
campaign = Campaign(
    name="my_campaign",
    endpoint="http://localhost:8080",  # optional
    harness=harness,
    steps=["discover", "analyze", "decide"],
)

result = campaign.run()
print(f"Campaign: {result.name}")
print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Notes: {result.notes_path}")
```

```bash
# Run a campaign from the command line
gobbonet-agentic \
  --name my_campaign \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8080 \
  --notes-dir ./notes \
  --steps step1 step2 step3

# Offline mode (no endpoint)
gobbonet-agentic \
  --name offline_campaign \
  --notes-dir ./notes

# Output as JSON
gobbonet-agentic \
  --name my_campaign \
  --json

# Self-test
gobbonet-agentic --self-test
```

## The harness

The harness orchestrates a campaign autonomously from start to finish, recording:
- Campaign start/end with timestamps
- Each step's execution and outcome
- Errors and decisions made
- All events into a structured JSON notes file

Fails closed: if notes cannot be written or a step fails, the campaign stops
rather than continuing silently with a broken log.

## Design

This brick answers one question: **Run one complete campaign where every decision
and outcome is recorded automatically.** It works standalone — install, run, get
notes. No manual intervention needed.

- **Autonomous** — no human note-taking, the harness records everything
- **Offline capable** — works without an external service
- **Structured notes** — timestamped JSON events, not prose logs
- **Fail-closed** — cannot proceed if recording fails

## Offline mode

If no endpoint is provided, the campaign runs in offline mode. The harness still
keeps notes but doesn't attempt external service calls:

```python
campaign = Campaign(
    name="standalone_campaign",
    harness=harness,
    # no endpoint, offline mode
)
result = campaign.run()
```

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest
```

Tests verify:
- Harness creates and manages notes directories
- Campaign records all events
- Notes files contain valid JSON
- Offline mode works
- Fail-closed behavior on errors

## Exit codes

From the CLI:

- `0` — campaign completed successfully
- `1` — campaign failed during execution
- `2` — could not initialize or malformed arguments

## Where it sits

Part of the `aw` family — standalone tools that replace something you would
otherwise have to trust with something you can check.

| package | question |
|---|---|
| `gobbonet-agentic` | **how do we know what the harness did?** |
| [`awm`](https://github.com/Aitherium/awm) | what does the agent remember? |
| [`awgit`](https://github.com/Aitherium/awgit) | who else is editing this right now? |

## The aw family

Standalone tools that share one idea: **replace something you would otherwise have to _trust_ with something you can _check_.**

Each installs on its own, works offline, and needs no account.

| [awm](https://github.com/Aitherium/awm) | that memory stayed in its lane | tenant:user:project scopes, so a write cannot cross a boundary |
| [awnode](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnode) | a vendor's cloud with every prompt | a local gateway routing to backends you chose |
| [awgraph](https://github.com/Aitherium/awgraph) | that grep found everything | an AST + tree-sitter call graph an agent can traverse |

| [awtoll](https://github.com/Aitherium/awtoll) | that your tooling is saving you context | the measured token cost of each tool call, and what the alternative cost |
| [awseal](https://github.com/Aitherium/awseal) | that the artifact came from who you think | an Ed25519 seal — the key that verifies is not the key that forges |
| [awshare](https://github.com/Aitherium/awshare) | that the download is intact | content-addressed bundles, verified on fetch |
| [awnest](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnest) | that there is a person on the other end | a verdict with evidence, where "we could not tell" is not "yes" |
| [awrena](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrena) | a leaderboard someone can edit, and votes nobody counted | a scored duel with both answers kept, and a result bound to them |
| [awnboard](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnboard) | a share link anyone who sees it can use | an invitation addressed to one person, for one gate, revocable |
| [awnix](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) | that the box is what you left it as | an immutable image you built, with atomic rollback |

| [awask](https://github.com/Aitherium/awask) | that anyone read the paragraph where you asked | the ask itself, with a button that steers the session that raised it |
| [awmail](https://github.com/Aitherium/awmail) | a mailbox somebody else can read | mail your agents send and receive over your own server |
| [awswarm](https://github.com/Aitherium/awswarm) | that a model either fits your GPU or it doesn't run at all | a placement plan and an acquisition-probability estimate before you spend on a run |
| [awfind](https://github.com/Aitherium/awfind) | one vendor's idea of the web | results from whichever providers you configured |
| [awbrowse](https://github.com/Aitherium/awbrowse) | that the page said what you were told | the render, the DOM and the requests it made |
| [awvoice](https://github.com/Aitherium/awvoice) | that a cloud vendor may hold your audio | a transcript and a wav from a service you host |
| [awvision](https://github.com/Aitherium/awvision) | a filename and a caption somebody wrote | what a model actually reports about the pixels |

| [awwall](https://github.com/Aitherium/awwall) | that a service only talks to the hosts you think it talks to | an explicit egress allowlist, where a denial names the rule that denied it |
| [awembed](https://github.com/Aitherium/awembed) | a general-purpose embedder that has never seen your code | a held-out split of whole directories, scored teacher vs student vs int8 |
| [awtax](https://github.com/Aitherium/awtax) | a closed tax app's sealed file you can never read again | a plain, provider-neutral schema of every figure, with the page it came from |
| [awsettings](https://github.com/Aitherium/awsettings) | that you will remember to re-approve the same thing on every box you work from | one profile, unioned rather than overwritten, with the credentials left behind |
